I just realized. Lusers are the vuvuzelas of the software world.

OMG OMG OMG. In addition to totally fucked window controls, we now have [a
font][264]!

[264]: http://design.canonical.com/2010/07/the-ubuntu-font/

I'm so excited about this thing because it's going to fix so many problems. It's
going to make my 30 inch monitor work, and give me awesome 3d graphics, and all
the game companies will port to linux to take advantage of this font, and my
wireless problems will go away. And it will make Intel open source their gpu,
and Microsoft will roll over and die.

I mean seriously. That's what happened when they release Bitstream Vera, and
Liberation. Right? All the free desktop was missing was a fucking font.

Oh btw, will this make other websties that specify the standard web fonts look
good? No?
