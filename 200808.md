### One bug report to rule them all

[//p86]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20171216112924/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com:80/2008/08/one-bug-report-to-rule-them-all.html)

*Posted Monday, August 4, 2008 @ 1:32 PM. ? FLAMES*

Whatup y'all. I hope I haven't worn out all those refresh buttons on your
browsers. Just because I don't post for a few days, y'all want to declare the
death of this blog? You wish.

Anyways, today I'm talkin' about one of the community's crown jewels: bug
trackers. We've heard it all before. Open bug tracking increases collaboration,
transparency, and saves lives of poor, hungry children, etc.

But guess what? take a look at the bug trackers out there. They're mostly full
of hogwash. Most of the bug reports go something like this...

Johnny User writes...  

`Hi. I'm trying to use ellipticaljerk-0.3.2, but my speakers make a farting
sound when I click the jerk button. Then it crashes. Is this a bug?`

Sammy Developer writes...  

```
Hi Johnny. The jerk button works for me.

Bug status updated: CLOSED - USER ERROR
```

Sally User writes...  

```
I'm also seeing this problem. These farting noises suck.

Bug status updated: REOPENED
```

Sammy Developer writes...  

`Ok, fine. Could you give me some more information? A backtrace maybe?`

Johnny User writes...  

`What's a backtrace?`

Sammy Developer writes...  

`It tells me where the problem is. You need to make sure you have debugging
symbols installed. Also please tell me which compiler, which glibc, and which
libjerk you are using.`

Johnny User writes...  
`What are debugging symbols? How do I figure out all this information?`

Sally User writes...  

```
Johnny, I know what Sammy is asking for. Here's the info:

gcc-4.1.3
glibc-2.5.1
libjerk-0.8a

backtrace:

```

Sammy User writes...  

`Thanks Sally. Except that I can't reproduce this bug. But I'm using glibc-2.5.2
beta and libjerk-cvs`

Sally User writes...  

`I don't know how to use the versions you talk of. And besides, this is how it
behaves on Ubuntu. I don't care about how it works on your computer. It is
broken in Ubuntu Masturbating Monkey.`

Joe User writes...  

```
OMG, I'm so glad I found this report. I think I have a related problem. I'm
trying to play videos using mplayer for my wife, but she farts in my face
everytime I have to look at the man page to remember the options. Here's my
xorg.conf. Could you help me?

(A huge long xorg.conf that makes a bug page a huge pain to navigate)

```

Sammy Developer writes...  

`Joe, you need to file a separate bug for that.`

Johnny User writes...  

`When will this bug be fixed? I thought Open Sauce meant that if I report the
bug, it'll get fixed`

Sammy Developer writes...  

`Johnny, I can't reproduce it. Feel free to send me a patch`

(a few months later) Sammy Developer writes...  

```
Upstream libjerk-0.9 fixes this problem.

Bug status updated: FIXED
```

(6 months later) Johnny User writes...  

`I just updated to Ubuntu Naughty Nutgoblin, and this broke again...`

Sammy Developer writes...  

```
It works for me. It must be Ubuntu's fault. I don't know what patches they
apply, so please file a bug with them.

Bug status updated: WON'T FIX
```

Joe User writes...  

`What about my bug? Will you please fix it? My wife is still farting at me.`

Yep. That sounds about right to me. Open bug trackers are filled with so much
noise that there's a constant call for "triagers", which really are zealous
volunteers suckered into cleaning out the accumulated crap.\* Meanwhile, all the
noise hides the real issues, causes developers to get frustrated, and slows
progress. It's no wonder companies rarely open up their bug trackers. If you
do, you're just asking for it.

I stopped filing bugs long ago. If you're gonna ask me to do it for free, you
should at least make sure it's worth my time.

Bug trackers can be useful tools to coordinate work between competent
developers and testers who speak the same language, and who work within a
well-design development workflow. But as a mechanism to collect problem reports
from clueless non-technical users, they FAIL in the EPIC manner. So y'all need
to stop acting as if an open bug tracker is some crazy new innovation that is
going to make FOSS better than all other software. I bet these things slow you
down as much as they help.

\* by the way, the idea that just anyone can effectively triage bugs is a huge
load of crap as well. Anyone who has worked at a real software company writing
huge complex software will tell you the same.

### Rants and Laughs

Argh. I'm getting way behind on these things, so I'm combining the Rants and
Laughs posts into one series. I can feel that we're getting closer and closer to
becoming the anti-slashdot. Perhaps ~/. is an appropriate way to refer to this
site.

First the rants:

### Challenged

[//p88]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20171013190439/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/08/yay.html)

*Posted Friday, August 8, 2008 @ 10:57 PM. ? FLAMES*

Yay. [A challenge][163]. But before I start, let me point out a few mistakes you've already made:

[163]: http://pthree.org/?p=647

1. You commented on my blog.
1. You replied to another commenter. (Hell, even I know not to do that)
1. You challenged me.

You know, I don't even know if I want to spend so much time on this. It looks
like commenters on your blog already called you on your bullshit. There's not
really much for me to add. But I'll try anyways.

Really? That's your opener? Did you even try googling for "windows automated
install" before you wrote that? Hey, why not try "windows 95 automated install"
for that matter. [Boom][164]. I AM feeling lucky.

[164]: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/win95/w95auto.mspx?mfr=true

Hey BTW, FYI, JIC, for your future reference, you should try googling things
before you make claims like this. It turns out, Microsoft actually writes this
thing called "documentation". AND it's not out of date like 10 minutes after
it's written, just because someone replaced a working subsystem with something
"shiny".

Wow. I have to know what a kernel module and a terminal command to set up a
firewall? Can I just have XP's default firewall, which can let me pass through
specific apps on-demand and in just a few clicks?

Thank God! My rogue script only deleted my home directory! I'm so happy it
spared my /usr/lib! I just have to reinstall Ubuntu to get my home directory
back, right?

So, out of the crapware you listed that comes with Linux, the only ones that I
could possibly want are OO and pidgin, and guess what, you can get those for
Windows. Yay! Zip files? Have you heard of right-click, send to compressed
folder? Yay! Tar and bzip? turns out you don't need a separate archiving format
and compression format if you support one that does both (zip).

But the thing you keep repeating is that none of this stuff is provided by
default. Guess what? Windows lets you install 3rd party software that you
download from a website. Look Ma! No compiler! Imagine that. But best of all, I
don't have to update my entire distro to get Firefox 3.

I don't know why you freetards sit around optimizing installers all the time. If
you had actually designed your system properly, I'd install once, like 4 years
ago, and then I'd never care again. My secret theory is that it's exactly
because you have a 6 month update cycle that you care so much about your sacred
install time.

Let's do some math. Let's say I set up XP once 3 years ago, and never had to do
any installs, and it took me like 2 hrs to get the base OS and the apps that I
use. Now if I had install Ubuntu, I'd be on my 6th update, and all the package
downloads and installs takes at least 30 minutes each time, plus fixing the all
the shit that broke takes at least (and I'm being super generous here) 10 hrs
each time, so we arrive at a grand total of 63 hrs. 63 vs 2. Awesome. Thanks for
playing.

### Bundle me this

*Posted Tuesday, August 12, 2008 @ 12:57 AM. 185 FLAMES*

Hey y'all. Sorry about the whole comment thing. I've decided (like many of you
also have) that disqus sucks (threading seemed like a good idea, until it
indented so much that you couldn't even see the messages), so let's go back to
the old Blogger comments. Besides, having comments stored in a separate site is
still a little weird in the web-2.0-epic-fail kinda way.

BTW, in case you've been wondering where I've been for the past few days...
well, you see, there's this little thing going on called the Olympics. Oh, and
if you go to the NBC site, you can use this thing called Silverlight and watch
tons of footage of sports that I never got to see before. But I know you lusers
can't see any of that stuff, so instead you were busy commenting away on the
last post. Sounds like fun. Sorry I couldn't join you.

But really, what I wanted to talk about today is bundling. As in "shipping
software with your OS", not "what you want to do with Jessica Alba".

Lusers like to always bring up the whole IE + Windows thing as an example of
Micro$oft being evil. And somehow the EU caught the same mental disease and
continues to go after them over a stupid media player. Those same lusers will
also talk about how the latest release of their favorite distro has so much
software out of the box that you don't need to install anything else.

Do you guys like being ironic? And don't even try to get me started about Apple.

The thing that everyone likes to forget in the IE 3/4/5 days when all this shit
happened was that IE's (especially 4 and 5) were better browsers than what
Netscape had to offer. Yes, it was ever so slightly more inconvenient to use
Netscape (the huge download size of Communicator didn't help), but there was
also no reason to go through the trouble.

And what do you know? When something like Firefox comes along, which is actually
better than IE in many ways, people start to use it. OMFG. Shocking.

Then there was that whole bit about M$ giving IE away for free. That was what
really killed Netscape, but the freetards don't really talk about that part of
it now do they? Oh hellz no, they're trying to give M$ some of its own medicine.
Except there's a huge difference. Microsoft had a business plan when they made
that fateful decision. Give away the browser, sell the OS. Freetards on the
other hand? Uhh. Uhh. Uhh. Oh! I got it, let's whore out the search bar! Yay!

Some lusers like to think it was the Mozilla folks collective business genius
that made Firefox successful. Sorry to break it to you, but it was Google that
figured out how to make the dough. They just happen to also realize that giving
a tiny bit of it to Firefox could benefit them. FF was, as they say, just in the
right place at the right time. Let's just keep things in [perspective][166],
pleez?

Idiotry at Slashdot [continues][179].

This is so typical. Without having any evidence whatsoever, lets blame the
closed-sourceness of Flash for all of desktop Linux's problems.

When will you lusers fucking learn? In case you haven't noticed, users want
Flash. Say it again. Users want Flash. Anything you do to make Flash not work is
your fucking fault. Not Flash's. Yours. At some point in time in the past, Flash
worked on Linux. In some configuration. Otherwise Adobe wouldn't have released
it. Whatever you did to deviate from that configuration is your responsibility.
Not Adobe's. The fact there are a bazillion Linux configurations that Adobe
couldn't possibly test: OSS sound, or Alsa sound, or alsa-oss sound, or pa-alsa
emulation, or pa-alsa-oss-jack-esound-vagina emulation, or all of the above
inside nspluginwrapper, or whatever the fuck... it's all your fault. Not
Adobe's.

I don't give a shit if Flash is the worst piece of code since Microsoft Bob.
Your users want it. That's all that matters. If you ever cared about your users,
you'd give them what they want. Users don't give a shit whether your browser is
open source, or whether you have the latest greatest audio system with shitty
emulation of the 20 audio systems that came before it.

When you guys have actually bent over backwards to make Flash work for your
users, only then can you even beging to complain to Adobe about what they do to
make it difficult. Right now, Linux is the making it difficult for Flash, NOT
the other way around.

As if it weren't enough, the Slashdot entry finishes with:

> I really do have to suspect Adobe's motivation for keeping Flash on Linux in
> such a deplorable state.

Are you shitting me? Yes, Adobe's spending precious developer resources to
release a half-assed version of Flash just to subvert the Linux desktop. If you
maybe had one more brain cell (bringing you to a grand total of one), you'd
realize that it's actually beneficial to Adobe if the Linux desktop takes off.
They have the only credible cross-platform rich application delivery mechanism
in Flash and Flex. When Linux spreads, MS-specific technologies like Silverlight
look worse and worse to developers. As diversity increases, cross-platform Flash
looks increasingly appealing.

But no. You guys not only make it hard for Adobe to ship anything that works,
you have to swiftboat Adobe and accuse them of subverting the cause. I hope
Adobe just stops supporting Linux altogether for a year or two. Just to teach
you lusers a lesson. Then you can concoct some crazy wine-based browser plugin
emulation scheme to make the windows Flash run on Linux, and then write another
article complaining that Adobe not open sourcing their Flash plugin makes it
difficult for lusers to port it to FreeBSD or some shit.

### Certified to suck

Hey guys. Turns out, I had the awesome privilege to look in to Linux
certification this past week. You know, like how when Novell says SUSE runs well
on some laptops, then, well, it should? Well, turns out they have a funny
definition of "well".

So umm, lets see, say I'm looking at [HP's certification page][180], and I
decide the 6510b is the one I want. Oh, look, it's certified by Novell. But you
know, I'm thorough, so let me check out the [certification report][181].

Nice, this thing is YES CERTIFIED. Ok. So far so good. Let me take a look under
the Tested Configuration spec. Desktop Effect Enabled? Yes. Cool. Power
Management? Also Yes. Sweet. That means I'm set to go right?

Oh, what are these Config Notes?

Uhh. Certifcation Fail? How the hell is this acceptable? You're telling me that
you've certified a machine that, when I put to sleep, I might "Occasionally"
lose my data? Great guys. You've proved to me that your definition of working
"well" really means "occasionally, not at all".

And then farther down on that page, look at the driver that they used to check
the video card. fbdev\_drv.so? Seriously? the frame buffer driver?

YES! I'm certified to have a 1990's era desktop experience with this machine.
Super Hyphy. So now, not only do I know that the experience will likely suck on
this machine, I also have no idea what the hell you mean when I see all the
other machines that have been certified.

I'm glad you've got all this money from Microsoft and you've decided to invent a
huge system that tells me absolutely nothing. Think of all the Ximian folks that
you could have paid to stay to maybe actually finish Evolution.

  Which means you definitely should read it.

### National Convention of Anarchy

What else happens every four years other than the olympics? Why, the DNC!

OMGWTF! [I can't view the videos using Linux! EPIC FAIL!][190]

[190]: http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/25/229210&from=rss

Slashtards. Seriously, how do you keep doing it? How do you stay so inspired? I
find myself struggling to keep up.

First of all, they do support Windows and Mac. So, that's like 99% of all
computers. Why don't we first worry about the people *who don't have computers*,
instead of worrying about the 1% of computer users who just like being fucking
annoying.

But that last 1%, don't we care about them too? or wait just a second, do the
Democrats not care about lusers? Could it be? Such an intelligent, polite crowd?
What if they are the swing vote? Doesn't their quest for freedom synergize with
the Democratic message? Don't we want them on our side?

Even though their numbers are small, they're *all* on the internets! And like 23
hrs a day! They could all unite behind a common cause, organize, work together,
and .... oh wait. Ha ha. I get it now. They can't even do that to produce a
working operating system. What makes anyone think they can do it in *real life*?

Yes that's right folks. Lets not kid ourselves. Linux is not a democracy. Linux
is anarchy. Everyone going in their own damn directions. It's not about working
together. It's about works for me! It's not Yes *We* Can, it's Yes *I* Can.

So if you guys want to create all your own rules and abide by them on your silly
internet chatrooms, be my guest. Just don't come bitching when you find out that
the real world doesn't really care about you.

BTW guys. A few words of advice.

You can watch the damn thing on TV. You know that thing you could watch if only
your video capture card was actually supported under Linux? I hear there are
like a bajillion TV-compatible devices. Why don't you go enjoy your analog hole
why you still can?

Also, if you're making your political decisions based on all the contrived,
sugar-coated moments that they broadcast during the conventions, you're already
lost. Go read a newspaper or something. I hear there's also this globally
accessible network of computers that is actually a good place to read about what
the candidates really stand for.

### My perl caught a bug

[//p95]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20160804011536/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-perl-caught-bug.html)

*Posted Friday, August 29, 2008 @ 8:02 PM. 180 FLAMES*

There were a lot of things that I could have written about this week. Like, for
example, Red Hat [getting p0wned][191]. Or how freetards in Quebec [want their
goverment to be even more inefficient][192]. (Does this mean now they have to
come to the US to buy their copy of Windows, along with their MRI's?)

[191]: http://lwn.net/Articles/295134/
[192]: http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/28/0310216

No, the fruit ripest for the picking this week is [Red Hat's perl
performance][193] bug.\* Long story short, it turns out that the version of Perl
that RH shipped has a huge performance bug that a whole bunch of people have
just been working around. There's also apparently a [bug report][194] open about
this that's been around for the better part of a year. Nicolas Clark, a core
perl developer, also [chimes in on how Red Hat fucked up][195].

[193]: http://blog.vipul.net/2008/08/24/redhat-perl-what-a-tragedy/
[194]: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=379791
[195]: http://use.perl.org/~nicholas/journal/37274

The bug itself is not that interesting. It's just a performance bug. Whatever,
it happens. But it's everything around it that has the ever so recognizable
luser stench.

First there's the bug report it self. Go ahead, read through the comments. It's
full of a bunch of whiners being actively hostile in an attempt to get RH to fix
the bug. Way to set an example guys. To all the companies who have yet to go
deploy a public-facing bugzilla, you're effectively saying, "do this, and we
will shit all over you whenever you have a bad bug." It's a really great way to
show that open bug DB's can be good for companies. \*\*

Second, it's yet another example of where access to the source code causes
stupid things to happen. RH released a version of the source code that upstream
never released. I guess they have the freedom to do so, in this case, this
freedom wasted a bunch of time for a bunch of people.

Third, is something that the upstream developer notes this himself:

> RedHat seem to have an aggressive policy of incorporating pre-release changes
> in their released production code. This would not be so bad if they actually
> communicated back with upstream (i.e. me and the other people on the
> perl5-porters mailing list), or demonstrated that they had sufficient in-house
> knowledge that they didn't need to. But evidence suggests that neither is
> true, certainly for 5.8.x

*Just because you have the source code, doesn't mean you have the expertise to
maintain it, modify it, and release it*. This is one of the biggest fallacies of
the open source model. Lusers always like to say that as long as they have the
code, they can make it work and fix things themselves. Never do they say that as
long as they have the code, they have way more opportunities to fuck things up,
because they often have no idea how or why the code was written as it was. This
is just another example of this. \*cough\* Debian \*cough\* SSL \*cough\*

\* Bad week for them, I suppose.

\*\* Not that people don't do this already on various forums and bulletin
boards. But when the nastiness appears on the same company-hosted page that
everyone else is going to be looking at to find a solution, it looks especially
bad.
