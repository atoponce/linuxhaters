### Wile E Reality catches up to FreeRunner

Sweetness. Looks like the FreeRunner is [finally dead][248].

I’d just like to take a moment, and lament about all the top notch features we
could have had with a truly open source phone like the FreeRunner.

* grep’ing through your address book using extended regular expressions
* finger’ing your Fav Five
* Having 10 different competing UI’s packaged by dozens of different
  distributions
* Being able to ssh to your phone so that you can check it’s uptime
* Using PGP to sign your SMS messages. Beware though, after the signature,
  you’ll only have 5 characters left to work with.
* Sending people videos in ogg theora format
* Losing data randomly with ext4
* Unloading the kernel module for the asterisk button because I never use it
* Changing your keypad to dvorak layout, where the most commonly used numbers
  are in the middle row
* Using gkrellm to monitor your battery power, as it is slowly sucked away by
  gkrellm
* More efficiently using your tiny screen with a tiling window manager
* Running only free and open javascript
* Warning users that their keypad lock password is not strong enough
* E17, some day. No, really, someday.

### Can we do this guy a favor?

I dunno why this caught my eye, [but it did][249].

Why don't we do this guy a favor and answer his question? Give yourself the warm
fuzzies by preventing another tragedy.
