Just found out about [u1db][266].

[266]: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bspec/desktop-p-u1db

The Ubuntu One team have started work on u1db, a project codename for an
easy-to-use database API layer which can work on any platform (Ubuntu, web
servers, Windows, smartphone platforms) with the existing native databases
(SQLite, MySQL, API layers, everything)

Is it just me, or does this sound like the database equivalent of pulse audio? I
can't wait until we have the ultimate abstracted UI. The one that lets you watch
porn in the same way across all platforms. It will have to be open source, of
course.

Seriously though. If I've learned anything, it's that OSS projects can't make a
choice. And when you can't make a choice, what do you do? You support all
options! Yay! How do we support all options? An abstraction layer! Yay!
Abstraction layers are fun to write! Yay!
