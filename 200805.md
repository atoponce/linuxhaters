### Linux Sucks  

[//p1]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20171012164051/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/05/linux-sucks.html)

Yeah, I said it. Whatcha gonna do about it? Fuck if I care that blogspot.com
probably runs on it. It still sucks. Did the blogspot guys think that VMware's
corporate logo was also GPL? So much for creativity and innovation. Oooh you
added a box. Sweet.

And I'm not the only one. You'll see. Stay tuned, and we'll bring the purest,
most refined hatred of Linux you'll find on the 'nets.

### I hate Copy and Paste  

[//p2]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20170104083123/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/05/i-hate-copy-and-paste.html)

*Posted Wednesday, May 7, 2008 @ 2:25 PM. 61 FLAMES*

You see, there's this totally awesome feature called copy and paste. These
smart guys at Xerox PARC invented it. It lets you takes some text from one
document and put it in another.

Well Linux does it even better! It gives you two copy and pastes!

How are they different? one is PRIMARY and the other is CLIPBOARD. Get it? One
way, you select the text that you want, and middle click. Another way you can
select what you want, hit the copy key or menu, and then paste. But if you know
what's good for you and your family, you won't mix the two.

Select some text, and then hit Control+V in another app? nada. Incorrect.

Select some text, then move to an xterm and hit Shift+Insert? works. But try it
on a pidgin chat window? Fail.

But don't worry. It's all good. [It's in the standard][1].

[1]: http://standards.freedesktop.org/clipboards-spec/clipboards-latest.txt

Let's see. Listed disadvantages of having two clipboards:

- inconsistent with Mac/Windows
- confusingly, selecting anything overwrites the clipboard
- not efficient with a tool such as xclipboard
- you should be able to select text, then paste the clipboard over it, but that
  doesn't work if the selection and clipboard are the same
- the Copy menu item is useless and does nothing, which is confusing
- if you think of PRIMARY as the current selection, Cut doesn't make any sense
  since the selection simultaneously disappears and becomes the current
  selection

Ok, but there must be some awesome advantages to justify these disadvantages.

> PRIMARY is an "easter egg" for expert users, regular users can just ignore
> it; it's normally pastable only via middle-mouse-click.

Sweet. So it's a cool 3l33t h4x0r feature, but if you try to use it, don't
complain that it's poorly designed. Let's not try to add a feature that's
useful to everyone. Instead, lets add something that requires a certain level
of intellect and mental capacity to use effectively. Because it's one of those
features that make our platform awesome. And it makes people who use it
smarter. We're constantly training their brains to track two clipboards instead
of one.

Hey Ma! Check it out, I can middle click! Oops, I accidentally scrolled because
I have to push my scroll wheel in. I bet you didn't even know that you could
push the scroll wheel in. I'm so much better than you.

### Linux won't get you hot chicks

[//p3]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20171012154109/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/05/linux-wont-get-you-hot-chicks.html)

Yea, I'm a nerd. So what. If you're reading this, by definition, you're a
bigger nerd than I am.

So here's the deal, the one IN that male computer nerds have with women is that
they can be their tech support. Oh, having problems with your laptop? I can fix
that for you. If you have any semblance of social skills, you can start from
this type of acquaintance and actually make her think that, "Oh, he's not just
computer nerd". You're on your own for the rest.

Point is, if you use Linux you're fucked (figuratively, NOT literally). Yea,
because you're also probably one of those types that avoid Windows because you
think it's evil, and by refusing to use the OS that 90% of the world uses, you
think it'll go away. Maybe even the Mac too. So when your opportunity comes
along to help out some attractive female with her computer problems, oops, you
don't know jack shit about her operating system. Kernel panic. Good going. Give
up and keep hoping that some hot blonde is going to come to you some day and
say, "I'm trying to run `somecommand 2>&1 > foo` but it's not working. Can you
help?"

If you manage somehow to recover from your catastrophic deficiency, you'll
probably then start a long the lines of, "Hey, you know your computer wouldn't
give you so many problems if you let me install this thing called Ubuntu on
it...". Yep, so then you'll get her to talk to you every day, because there
will be something she doesn't know how to do. Most of those things she actually
can't do, but instead you'll tell her about how she can file a bug, or how she
can write her own patch. Maybe you think that she'll appreciate you then
because you know so much about Ubuntu, but in fact she'll just hate you. And
she'll hate Linux, without even knowing what it is.

Besides, you're just being sneaky. At best you're a dirty used cars salesman
selling someone something by just only talking about it's good points. At
worst, you're forcing something upon her that she doesn't want. Some people
call that rape. Yep, it's computer rape.

### Linux sucks.. for watching Porn

[//p4]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20170803173112/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/05/linux-sucks-for-watching-porn.html)

*Posted Saturday, May 10, 2008 @ 11:49 PM. 30 FLAMES*

Linux people like to say that the OS is built for the internet. I'm not really
sure what that means. But ok, if it's built for the internet, then it should be
really good for watching porn right? I mean, what else is the internet good
for? Online banking? yea.. to pay your porn bill.

First problem: codecs. I have never seen an Ogg Theora based porn site. Every
get h264 working on your machine? uh huh. WMV? please.

Second problem: sound. For some retarded reason, sound never works well on a
Linux machine. Maybe you managed to download that new video, but now you only
get the video and no sound. Or maybe you get sound but your volume control is
fucked up so that you can only get mute or awesomely loud with one useless
notch in between. I mean, when it comes to porn, it's all about the loud-enough
but not loud-enough-that-the-neighbors-can-hear right?

Third problem: Maybe you've managed to subvert the first two problems by going
for a flash-video based site. I mean youtube is the future of porn right? Sure,
but using 64 bit linux cuz you're uber-awesome? fail. But I mean, a browser
totally need 64 bit address space, because you're gonna have 2\^63 tabs open
right? Yea it'd work if distros shipped 32bit firefoxes and a working
compatibility library, but nope, you lose. Yes, I know, you can install a damn
[32-bit chroot][2] ok. I've done it. It sucks.

[2]: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=733595

Maybe distros are trying to take the moral high ground but making it difficult
for their users to watch porn. Good for them.

All that money the save using Linux, you can spend on old fashioned adult
DVD's. Want to watch that DVD on your ubuntu distro? oops that's illegal.

### Where do I find people to come work on my lame project for free?

The only thing I hate more than Linux-toting Slashdot commenters are people who
actually take the time to send idiotic questions in to be answered on Slashdot.
[Like this one][3].

[3]: http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/08/05/11/219231.shtml

If you read this guy's question, he's basically saying. "Hi. I work on this
lame project. I don't understand anything about software development, so I told
some university that my project is like, totally supported and bugs get fixed,
without telling them that there's nobody to actually do that work. I think
supply and demand means that if there is a demand for people to do work for
free, then there will be a supply of free workers. Because my awesome project
is open source, all the developers in the world are going to come and help me
work on it for free. Where do I find people to do work that I promised to
someone else? And for free? I mean it's open source. This is an important
problem."

What the fuck. It's too bad you can't mod-down the original posts on /. instead
of just the comments.

I'm going to start an open source project to sleep with this dude's mom. I hope
he'll come and help me with it. I mean, it's open source.

### Open Source Branding

It was discovered that a boatload of Linux systems have guessable private keys.
Class, what did we learn today?

You see, opening your source code leads to more eyes looking at your code. Yes.
But leaving the distribution tasks to, well, distributions, means there are
also more *hands* (and guys, admit it, more dicks) to fuck your code up. I
gotta give it to this Slashdot commenter who correctly stated: this is SSL
[*with muppet extensions*][4].

[4]: http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=551636&cid=23391944

When you say there are more eyes, what you're really saying is that you can
look, but don't touch, 'cause you're probably a jackass. Oh wait, isn't that
exactly what a bunch of these shared source licenses from commercial companies
are? No shit, maybe they aren't just trying to subvert the GPL and free
society.

Would you trust your family to a car that a bunch of volunteer car designers
put together in their free time, each adding their own special touch without
communicating with each other? "Oh, I don't need this airbag. Besides, it makes
the car slower." Didn't think so.

People in the Linux community love to talk about how Linux is all cooperation
and programmer love-making. But just take a look. These people don't cooperate.
There are hundreds of slightly different distributions. Distributions don't
talk to upstream. Upstream doesn't talk to distributions. Ten different
programs are written to do the same thing in ten different shitty ways. When I
ask two people to work together to solve my problem, I don't mean, "please
independently come up with ten solutions each, none of which solve my problem.
Thanks."

### Linux sucks on the OLPC

### Use Linux to lower your customer's expectations

Advertising the fact that your product runs Linux seems to have an effect of
lowering expectations for some. Case and point, this little blurb out of a
[Wired review of the Asus eeePC 900][6].

[6]: http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/05/review-asus-eee.html

You know, cuz it's totally acceptable to ship a busted battery meter, or
something that you have to type some crazy hexadecimal key in every time you
want to get on the interweb. It ships Linux, so we can forgive it, right? Fuck
no.

Why won't these companies realize that the percentage of people who are going
to react the way that this reviewer did is less than 1%. Even big Linux nerds
are going to be annoyed. I mean they just spent their life working to spread
freedom to people who don't want it, and this is what Asus does with the free
fruit of their labor? Oh well. At least it's free. At least I can spend hours
hacking on a driver fix for something I just paid $500 for. Sounds like an
awesome weekend to me.

[Here's a blog post][7] that claims that what open source projects are missing
is product management. If some product managers show up, then all will be good,
since they will be able to take the list of things that users want and make
developers work on them.

[7]: http://www.productbeautiful.com/2008/05/02/why-product-management-is-open-sources-fatal-flaw/

Specifically, he says:

> Obviously, there is a huge gap between the expectations of the users and the
> developers. Who normally bridges that gap? Product Management.
> 
> If Pidgin had a Product Manager, they would have raised a flag on the change

You know what the problem is though? The developers *don't give a fuck* about
what the users want. I'd even wager to say that the larger a pure open source
project gets, the more arrogant the developers become. When you're small,
you'll do a bunch of stuff to try to get more users. When you're big, you know
that users aren't going away just because you change some small shit.

How the hell would adding PM's to the mix fix anything? What PM's gonna be
like, "oh I'm bored, and I see a bunch of developers who have no incentive to
listen to me, so I'm going to tell them what to do." And besides, the
developers will just respond with, "who the fuck are you?"

Society has solved this problem way way long ago. OSStards so easily forget
about this. If you want Pidgin devs to give you your fricking resizable text
input field, *pay them* to keep the feature. Or fork it and keep it yourself.

The role of product managers only shows up in a situation where developers need
to listen to their users so that they can keep putting food on the table. In
these situations, it's well recognized that devs need some herding, and left to
their own devices, will work on useless shit that users don't want, which will
hurt sales, which will hurt their own pay. Devs in such a situation will
*submit to (and even rely on) PM's because they see it is to their own
benefit*.

Take the cash out of the equation and what do you get? You get some douchebag
with an incomplete, inprecise picture of what users want, telling devs that
don't give a shit that they're doing stuff that users don't want. Why the fuck
would anyone care? And besides, open source projects already have product
management. It's called a bug tracker.

### OLPC sees the light

[//p11]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20170620003135/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/05/olpc-sees-light.html)

*Posted Friday, May 16, 2008 @ 7:43 PM. 15 FLAMES*

The NYTimes reports that [the OLPC project finally sees the light][8], and decides
to ship Windows along with Linux.

[8]: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/technology/16laptop.html

The reason? To quote the article:

> Education ministries want low-cost computers to help further education, but
> many see familiarity with Windows-based computing as a marketable skill that
> can improve job prospects.

Hmm, so some governments looked at the problem and thought: "Well we'd like to
give computers to our children, so lets go with a solution that teaches them a
platform that nobody else uses, and one that teaches them skills that they can
use to produce volunteer software projects for free. Being able to participate
in open software projects on their spare time will make their other problems
like hunger, poverty, and disease seem insignificant. That sounds like a great
idea!"

A few minutes later, after that good African Ganja wore off.. "Wait. What the
fuck. This is a *terrible* idea! Of the small percentage of children who will
even learn to turn these things on, we want them to learn Windows, and make us
the CA$H MONEY."

You can't blame them. Look how much the money the Microsoft ecosystem makes.
Not just for MS, but for all the other companies involved. The Linux ecosystem?
Please. If you're going for your first piece of the pie, you're gonna go for
the bigger pie.

Besides how many of these kids are going to become programmers anyway? Probably
like 0.0001%. But you know, Ubuntu needs another person to work on their shit
for free, so it's worth it right? Nevermind teaching the 99.9999% of the other
kids about computer skills that matter.

And all these people who talk about how Windows needs more hard drive space and
shit. Maybe so, but the difference doesn't matter, because *the software is so
much better*. Only lusers choose to have more hard drive space over useful
software. Because, you know, empty flash drives are so useful. Besides, in a
year, the same storage space will cost half as much, and they'll be whining
about something else that doesn't matter.

What would a Linux haters' blog be without an occasional shout-out to Mr. RMS
himself? He recently wrote about ["rescuing" the OLPC project][10] just so that he
can remind us that he's a maniac. Maniac! And not just on the dance floor.

[10]: http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/can-we-rescue-olpc-from-windows/blogentry_view

Before I unleash his full lunatic flavor, let me point out that the man is
still using an IBM T23. That's right. 23. Apparently [it's a screamer][11], *in
2001*.

[11]: http://pcworld.about.com/news/Oct232001id66686.htm

Anyhow, that's not the best part. He goes on to suggest (emphasis added):

> Proprietary software keeps users divided and helpless. Its functioning is
> secret, so it is incompatible with the spirit of learning. Teaching children
> to use a proprietary (non-free) system such as Windows does not make the
> world a better place, because it puts them under the power of the system's

According to the S-man, the rest of the world (aka Windows users) are no better
than a swarm of crack heads, wandering the corners looking for our next re-up.
The good stuff provided, of course, by the biggest drug cartel in the world --
Microsoft -- with Billy-G as the biggest king-pin of them all. Maybe we need to
convince McNolty and crew to pull some kind of scam so that we can get a wire
up on the Microsoft campus. I mean, with all the shit they're pulling, they
must have a ton of bodies in a ton of vacants somewhere right? I mean there's a
reason Marlo Stanfield's initials are MS right?

Once again, it's obvious that there's only one crackhead in the room. You could
have probably figured it out from just appearances alone. I'm sure this man's
idea of improving the OLPC would be to give it to poor kids with the great
emacs as the main UI. And I'm sure the kids would then spend two hours figuring
out C-x C-c, then proceed to use it as a soccer ball. A soccer ball with an
open BIOS. Perhaps one of them will be sufficiently motivated to code up a
soccer-mode, which will make the device make cool whooshing sounds as it zooms
through the air. But most of the kids will just wonder why the first world
decided to donate them such awkwardly shaped soccer balls.

### Release cycles are for lusers

[//p13]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20170618012530/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/05/release-cycles-are-for-lusers.html)

*Posted Tuesday, May 20, 2008 @ 10:39 AM. 37 FLAMES*

Mark Shuttleworth, communist leader of the Nation of Ubuntu, and Aaron Seigo,
figurehead for *La Resistance* (read: "I work on the desktop system that
doesn't matter") are going at it regarding release cycles.

As much as I hate Linux, I gots mad respect for Shuttleworth. He's one of the
few dudes that actually understands that the problem with Linux these days is
not about code, it's about coordination. He's pointing out the fact that if OSS
devs are going to continue to be dickheads and not work together, then there's
no hope of fixing [bug #1][12]. His recent suggestion was for major open source
projects to [coordinate release cycles][13].

[12]: https://launchpad.net/bugs/1
[13]: http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/146

Unfortunately, Aaron responds with a standard [dickheaded response][14]. He
says that he can't see what the value of synchronicity among releases is,
especially if it reduces upstream productivity.

[14]: http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2008/05/re-singing-in-tune.html

Aaron, as well as many others like him, has forgotten that the vast majority of
self-mutilating Linux users use *releases*, not random code checked into
upstream at random points in time. The value of synchronicity is that *it makes
for good releases*. It starts to whittle away at the huge pile of bullshit that
Linux users deal with. Why are compiler versions among the distros different,
Aaron? Why are KDE versions different? Why are there so many different
*shipped* versions of glibc? Do upstream developers actually like the fact that
version X.1 is used there, and X.2 here, and X.3 over there, so that when an
actual bug does come up, they can just say "not our fault!". Is it a big
fucking smoke screen? Or maybe it's a hippie conspiracy to make sure that
nobody ever writes commercial software for the platform by making it impossible
to ship.

Synchronized releases also let everyone cooperate on testing. Everyone has the
same bits, so information about bugs and fixes can be shared across everyone.
But as Aaron says, clearly this has no value. Because you know, shit works for
him.

Sadly, Aaron's response it typical. OSS developer's instincts are to optimize
for developers. And every developer hates discipline, and so naturally they
hate disciplined release cycles. If they were truly working to improve the
lives of their users, then the benefit of coordinating release cycles would be
plainly obvious.

Oh wait, but Aaron [follows up][15]. After rambling on a bit more about how OSS
is nothing without the developers and how he doesn't care if anyone uses his
code, he writes:

Yes Aaron. Lets have Ubuntu and Redhat come along and branch some random state
of the tree. No matter that Joe Dickhead Developer just checked in something
that breaks something for everyone except him.

But ok, let's see, what would we need to actually implement your idea?

Hmm ... some kind of source code control system that makes branching by
external participants easy. Oh wait, isn't that what Bazaar does? Oh wait,
isn't that what Shuttleworth is pouring resources into?

Hmm ... then you'd need some kind of system to coordinate bugs between
downstream and upstream. Oh wait? isn't that what Launchpad does? Isn't that
what Shuttleworth is pouring resources into?

Oh, and what Aaron? You say you'd need to pick upstream projects that have
predictable branching schemes? Oh, isn't that what GNOME does? And isn't that
why Ubuntu went with Gnome from day one?

WTF dude. You can disagree all you want, but calling out people to start shit
that they've been doing for *years* is nothing but jackass-ery my friend.

And then goes on to list the benefits of *freedoms* of free software. The usual
standard blah blah blah, you can copy it, you can modify it and add your own
bugs, you can shit all over it and eat it for dinner, you can disable random
seeding and distribute it to millions of users, etc. Sweet. Too bad they forgot
the most import to freedom: the freedom to *consume content that you actually
give a shit about*.

Freddy Freetard deciding to use Linux instead of Windows isn't going to stop
Microsoft from writing DRM code. Freddy will just no longer be able to watch
what he wants to. And NBC or whoever probably won't care because Freddy was
bittorrenting all his shit to begin with.

It's not Microsoft that's causing DRM to happen. **_It's the content owners_**.
Microsoft is just enabling their platform to deliver shitty DRM content.
They're enabling new business models. If you don't like it, don't buy the
content. It worked for audio. Anyone who matters now sells mp3's. Why would it
not work for video?

But you know, go right ahead. Switch to Linux. Close yourself off from the
world. At least you won't have to deal with DRM. You can spend all the time you
spend hacking on your sound card driver, so that you can listen to that hot new
FLAC file of live drum circle recordings.

### Run Enlightenment on your cell phone. No, seriously.

Ars technica reports that the OpenMoko dudes are switching to QT and
*Enlightenment*?!?!? Cuz you know E17's gonna finally take over the world. It's
like totally hand optimized assembly to make your titlebars render faster and
shit.

The reason for the switch?

Oooooh, your shitty phone with a GPL dialer wasn't good enough huh? But don't
worry, the "community" will develop the interface that we're totally
abandoning. Cuz you know, there are so many OpenMoko users out there that will
want to save your discarded, rotting pile of fecal matter, let alone the one
that you actually maintain.

Going with Qt means they got a raging clue. But using "Enlightenment
technology" shows they're still raging mad.

Another [retarded question on Slashdot][17].

How exactly is it a Microsoft *Tax* if it makes the damn thing cheaper? Just
because Dell has figured out how to combine Windows and pre-installed software
to make their end product cheaper, doesn't mean it's not going to happen to
Linux someday. If there were only any 3rd party software that someone wanted to
run on Linux, then I'm sure Dell would be quite happy to ship that crapware
along with a pre-installed Linux if it lowered the number on their price tags.

Besides, that's like saying you're going to buy an unlocked phone for $400
more, just for the principle, and then use it for 2 years on AT&T; anyways.

Which makes me realize, the only thing Linux has got going for it is that it's
so hard to actually ship any software on it that no crapware developer in their
right mind would try to build any closed-source consumer desktop product for
Linux. Maybe that was Linux's stupid goal all along. To make a platform that is
such a constant moving target that it naturally evades crapware. Oh and BTW,
doesn't matter if that also happens to prevent any *useful* software from being
developed. It's still worth it so that I can have my machine with a pristine OS
and transparent terminals that still can't print my digital photos.

### You don't need to be a rocket scientist to use Linux, just merely a glibc hacker

Ulrich Drepper, of glibc fame, decided to tell us about how easy it was to [set
up a dual wide screen configuration][18] on his machine. After going on about
how dual head is so much easier to set up than it was before now that you don't
have to sacrifice your first born, he gets to the secret of his configuration:

Dude, he's calling it *magic*. *Ulrich Drepper* is calling it nonsensical
arbitrary bullshit. Setting up dual-head on Linux is non-obvious to a guy hacks
on *the* core system library. But surely, Linux is ready for your grandma.

We're not stupid or hateful enough to think that we have a monopoly on all the
hatred towards Linux and OSS. But we still want to be your one stop shop for
all your reasons to hate, so we'll just link you to the good stuff.

OpenSSL team a new one][19].

### My distro sucks more than your distro

Can someone make a distro for me? I mean, it seems like everyone has their own.
I'd like it to have a kernel, X, rxvt-unicode, fluxbox, Firefox, and pidgin.
And artwiz fonts. And call it HaterLinuxOS. It can have its own install
mechanism, it's own packages, and its own special OpenSSL patches to replace
AES with, `foreach byte: return byte - 1`.

Seriously, many luser hypocrites out there like to bash Microsoft for creating
five versions of Vista, and yet for some incomprehensible reason are euphoric
with the fact that there are *dozens* of Linux distributions, mostly
incompatible with each other in all ways that matter. Even your pretty-boy
Ubuntu's got Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Gobuntu, Suckubuntu, when they're all
the same damn packages! But you know, make it more confusing for potential
converts OK? Because they eat that up. Newbs want 50 initial choices, which
then expand to 5000 at the GRUB prompt.

But it gets worse. As if Linux fanboys weren't religious enough, they had to
subdivide themselves into distro fanboys. It reminds me of, well, the church.
Redhat is Roman Catholic Linux. Ubuntu is Protestant Linux. Debian is Orthodox
GNU/Linux. Gentoo is the Linux of Latter Day Saints.

But I know the TRUTH. There's only ONE Linux, son of Unix. Only He (yes Linux
is a dude, get over it) can save you. Praise Linux. Amen, nerds.
