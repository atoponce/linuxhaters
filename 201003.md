### A tale of ogg

Oh Ogg. The format that trapped many a user's music files on lowly Linux
desktops. I know I've got some oggs somewhere that I can't listen to any more in
itunes. Or any device that I care about, for that matter. And I'm too anal to
re-encode them into the only format that matters: mp3.

Then today I saw [this][262] nice little tear down of Ogg. I'm not going to
write much here since this article has a beauty of it's own. But I will quote a
bit:

Wow, doesn't this sound fucking familiar? Oh wait, %s/Ogg/Linux Desktop/g ...
Ahhh... there we go.
