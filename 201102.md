Bwahahahahaahah Nokia.

What a shit show in the making. It keeps getting better. And then of course
there's this [article][265]. Intel, if you have to say you're not blinking, then
you're blinking.

Quoth Intel:

Uh huh. Your strategy has been to develop a shitty choice that goes along less
shitty choices. If you're not building the "best" and just building a "choice",
that has fail written all over it.

And I love all these blogs claiming they should have gone for Android. HAVE ANY
OF YOU ACTUALLY USED WP7? Seriously. Just try it. It's at least as good as
Android. And it doesn't have the, "lets be like linux distros and invent a new
home screen UI for every damn phone" syndrome. OMG BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE COPY AND
PASTE! WTF people, Apple proved that you could ship a good phone w/o it. I'd
much rather use WP7 w/o c\&p\; than Android with it.

These bloggers smell of the "oh the last time I used anything Microsoft was
windows 98 and I'm not touching anything from them again!". Is there a TM for
that?

Nokia, with it's strategy of symbian, than maemo, then symbian, then meego, then
qt, then symbian, then linux, then symbian, then open source symbian, then gtk,
then qt, has clearly shown the open source is the way! Maybe that CEO dude meant
to say open source is the burning platform. As in, it burns you every time you
try to build on it.
