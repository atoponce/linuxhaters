### Word to your mother

reddit is fucking awesome. It really is. It's got this whole Linux section where
freetards automatically mod up the stupidest stories. I don't even have to go
looking for material any more. It's just there.

This evening, I'd like to give a little shout out to a great new blog I found:
"[Help for Linux][209]". This is like the archetype of a luser blog. Doesn't
seem very popular, but I don't really understand why, as it has scintillating
articles such as "[Is Fedora better than Ubuntu?][210]" or "[7 Reasons Why KDE
Sucks][211]" (I hope you have your shit-shield equipped, dude).

[209]: http://helpforlinux.blogspot.com/
[210]: http://helpforlinux.blogspot.com/2008/07/is-fedora-better-than-ubuntu.html
[211]: http://helpforlinux.blogspot.com/2008/08/7-reasons-why-kde-sucks.html

But one post caught my eye in particular: "Mombuntu - Ubuntu For Your Mom!"

This post starts with your standard "why Linux is better than Windows" crap. But
the rest of it is a list of instructions on how to set up Ubuntu so that it's
palatable to your mentally retarded mother. Among his useful suggestions:

* Install drivers that don't suck
* Create desktop shortcuts like "Internet" and "Word"
* Set OO to use the .doc format by default, "rather than explaining the
  difference between doc and odf"
* Set up auto-login
* Give her detailed instructions on how to write the Ubuntu forums or give her
  people to contact when she has questions
* As I was reading through this list, I surprsingly found myself in agreement.
  Most of these suggestions would actually be useful. They simplify the
  experience, and reduce the cognitivie dissonance for the poor mother whose son
  just totally p0wned her computer.

Then I thought to myself, why the fuck do I have to read this list on a luser
amateur's blog? *Why aren't these same steps done out of the box?* Really guys?
some random dude can come up with numerous concrete suggestions for improvements
in like 10 minutes?

Let's not forget that most of these steps are to make your brand new Linux act
more like Windows...

### Real time hate

Just wanted to mention, I've started a twitter feed:

I've always thought twitter was kind of lame, but we'll see how it goes.

### It's all about determination

[//p99]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20151026122831/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/09/its-all-about-determination.html)

*Posted Saturday, September 13, 2008 @ 6:46 PM. 236 FLAMES*

A [wonderful post on "Linux Weekly"][213] reminded me of another lame luser
talking point.

[213]: http://linux-weekly.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-first-linux-encounter-or-how-to.html

> I think one of the main reason most of the people try Linux and go back to
> Windows is that they aren't determined to make the switch, and they can't
> conceive that there are other ways of doing things than the Windows methods.
> If something is done differently on Linux, they quickly jump to a conclusion
> that goes like 'This is not right, on Windows it's done the other way around.

What the fuck? People don't switch to Linux because they aren't determined
enough?

Talk about putting the cart before the horse. You lusers always make the same
damn assumption, that for some self-mutilating reason,"people" actually *want*
to switch to Linux.

You know, it turns out that if you make something better and it makes people
*more productive* then people will switch to it, regardless of whether they are
"determined" or not. I mean look at Google Chrome for example. That thing has
been out one week and it already has more penetration than Linux on the desktop.

Making people more productive usually means either that a) they don't have to
learn anything new and they can do what they always did a little better, or that
b) they have to learn a tiny bit more, but they could do something before that
they couldn't previously.

For most people, switching to Linux is neither a) or b). You have to learn a
bunch of new stuff to do the same old shit. And by switching, you lose access to
tons of apps, thereby enabling you to do less. Oh but it does enable you to
spend many of your weekends now trying to learn to program so that you can fix
bugs and contribute code so that programs will let you do what you could already
do before you started going down this merry path. No, there is no command to
give you your life back.

Oh by the way, I have this invention that you might like. It's a new kind of
scissor. It's got one big handle hole to put your leg through, and another
smaller one to stick your dick through. It's really great. You can cut shit and
get off at the same time. I'm sure you can totally throw away your old scissors
it if you are determined enough to do so. So who wants one?

And before I go, Twitter is a flaming pile of shit.

### Wine, with a side of Chrome

[//p100]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20151026124052/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/09/wine-with-side-of-chrome.html)

*Posted Monday, September 15, 2008 @ 4:01 PM. 281 FLAMES*

I know I've already hated on the wine project before, but what the hell, it's fun!

I came across this really [wonderful story][214] today, about how CodeWeavers
has a wine-based package to run Chrome on Linux.

[214]: http://tech.slashdot.org/tech/08/09/15/1639216.shtml

First of all, isn't Chrome FOSS!? (as in fucking open source software?) Aren't
you supposed to port that shit, instead of create a matchsticks-and-glue
emulation of a proprietary API just to run an app written for another platform
that uses a bunch of open source libraries in the first place? Google totally
threw the source over to y'all. Where's the freetard brigade that's supposed to
patch it all up and make it run really great on Linux? Oh, right. I forgot.
They're busy [fighting Shuttle-man about Firefox][215]. Seriously guys.
Shuttleworth is some day going to really regret all that money he spent trying
to buy you guys a fucking clue.

[215]: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/+bug/269656

And secondly, look around wine dudes. Out of all the missing applications on
Linux, you decide to spend 11 days working on porting another browser. Sweet.
Because THAT's what Linux is missing right now. \*

But I shouldn't be surprised right? I mean if y'all had any kind of clue at all,
you'd realize that you only really need Wine to support three apps to make a
huge dent (and no, one is not Picasa). They are Outlook, Word, and Solitaire
(And I don't mean Outlook 2000 ok?). Spider Solitaire for extra credit. Oh, but
my bad, that would require some coordination and focus. I've read my own fucking
rants long enough that that I know that ain't gonna happen. Keep trying boys, if
you want to. I'll just remember to laugh at you again when the virtualization
boyz totally beat you to a pulp.

\* Which makes me think, aside from games and picasa, what useful apps does wine
let me run on Linux for which there is no OSS alternative? uTorrent? FAIL. EAC?
FAIL. Nope, I guess it really is [all games][216] these days. So much for being
productive on Linux.

### Free as long as you "give back"

[//p101]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20151026165853/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/09/free-as-long-as-you-give-back.html)

*Posted Wednesday, September 17, 2008 @ 10:15 PM. 286 FLAMES*

So like, this FOSS shit is supposed to be free right? Like I can take the code
and go make a bajillion dollars with it, or make some pretty awesome product
with it as long as I release all the source code when I'm asked to, right?

That's what the fucking license says right?

Well, apparently there's some stuff that they might have forgotten to stipulate.

Enter the infamous GregKH. mdz of Ubuntu [sums up his keynote speech at the
Linux Plumbers Conference quite nicely][217].

[217]: http://mdzlog.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/greg-kh-linux-ecosystem/

It turns out, with open source code, you can take a free kernel, integrate it
into a larger desktop distribution that manages to make like 10 people happy and
whole bunch of people wet their panties over Linux, and ship it marginally
successfully for several releases. But in the process, you might have just
forgotten to "give back" a little. You might have spent your time making the
desktop stack work better instead of the kernel or gcc. You might not have sent
in thousands of kernel patches because you were more worried about making Xorg
work, or codec installation easier.

It doesn't matter. Use the kernel in a media-visible way but don't actively
contribute upstream? Bingo! you get a big fat steamer on your doorstep. You get
called out at the opening speech of Luserfest 2008.

So you see? maybe the GPL isn't really free. Sure you can take the code, but
don't you dare go and do something that makes you seem like you have a bigger
dick than everyone else, at least, not without giving your testicles back to the
cause. The GPL just talks about the code. What it doesn't talk about is how you
also have to follow the "spirit" of open source, or be prepared for incoming PR
shit mortars.

This is fucking amateur hour people. You know what all those big software
companies do? They have PR people. Most engineers hate them, mostly because
they're yet another layer between you and your customer. Most customers hate
them too, because you're trying to explain what you want, and they don't really
have any clue what you're talking about. But then once in a while, you see
freetard engineers like Mr. KH here make an ass-clown of themselves, and then
you understand.

I'm glad your conference got off to such a great start. You're all gonna talk
about how you should improve Linux plumbing, and then spawn off like 20
projects, half-finish all of them, and call it progress. I'm like super serially
excited here.

### Mini-Rant

[//p103]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20151026122313/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/09/mini-rant.html)

*Posted Monday, September 29, 2008 @ 2:23 PM. 346 FLAMES*

And then there was another.

I was going to wait for the next Rants and Laughs, but this one is too good.
Jonathan Blow, a developer of the Braid game, starts out by [asking for some
solutions to problems][227] he's running into doing a Linux port of the game.

[227]: http://braid-game.com/news/?p=364

The freetard brigade arrives, and hilarity ensues, causing Jonathan to give up,
and then finish up with a comment worthy of an article here.

And since this is a mini-post, I'll leave you with a quick thought:

If you upgrade your version of Windows and an application breaks, it's
Microsoft's fault. If you upgrade your version of OS X and your application
breaks, it's the ISV's fault. If you upgrade your version of Linux and your
application breaks, well, that's your own damn fault.
