### Pulse my audio

I was saving this one until [this article][228] became free on LWN.net. It's
awesomeness is truly unparalleled.

[228]: http://lwn.net/Articles/299093/

Let me attempt to summarize.

A) PulseAudio needs to work with existing applications, so it implements an ALSA
emulation layer, except, it's not complete. Only 70% of ALSA applications work.
So it's like, totally ready.

B) So, in the true open source fashion, you should port your app to be a native
PulseAudio client. Except that you can't. There's this yet-another-audio-library
called libsidney, but it's not ready yet. (Hmm, this sounds familiar...)

C) Fedora led the way in incorporating PulseAudio before it was ready, breaking
audio for thousands of users. Then because open source is about copying good
ideas and bad ones, a ton of other distros adopted it as well. Amazing guys. In
a way, you've spread bad code that breaks audio on thousands of computers faster
than a virus could have. And it's immune to antivirus!

D) so now that we're in this "mess" (as the lead developer of PulseAudio calls
it\*), LSB comes along and says "we're going to standardize how your write audio
apps!" Oh, but wait, ALSA's now "old" (we hardly knew ye), and I can't directly
program PulseAudio. Hmm... So the article's brilliant solution? Standardize on
the PulseAudio-safe subset of ALSA.

WHAT THE FUCK.

I can just imagine the future alsa man page. A big listing of functions, with a
nice little asterisk next to those functions that you shouldn't use unless you
want your app to totally FAIL on a system which has been sodomized by Pulse
Audio. I can just see the developers of commercial Linux sound apps (all three
of them) jumping for joy.

And thus unfolds another chapter in long history of failed sound systems on
Linux. Can they make it much worse? I, for one, am excited to see how much worse
they can make it until we all go back to listening to square waves on our PC
speakers.

\* BTW, also notice that it's the PulseAudio guy calling Linux audio a mess. Did
he forget that it was his project that took the existing mess, and unloaded a
giant steaming turd on it? Congratufuckinglations. You've just made it worse.
You're a truly a worthy OSS contributor.

* Timothy Prickett Morgan at the Register writes about how [Linux is what
  Windows wanted to be][232]. Yes, an OS that supports a bazillion hardware
  platforms but has barely any useful applications. That's exactly what Windows
  wanted to be.

* An article about how [open source hippies have a hard time working at large

* Mr. Toponce, once again, from Planet Ubuntu, talking about [how Wikimedia has
  moved to Ubuntu][234]. In the process, he points all the shortcomings of
  Fedora, for example "*Fedora, although it strives for stability, never really
  gets that opportunity. Instead, each release is broken somehow, someway*" or
  "*Fedora places itself to be a test bed for new technologies and changes*".
  Umm yea. Because every Ubuntu release is perfect, and Ubuntu doesn't ship
  bleeding edge stuff like Pulse Audio in a LTS release.. oh wait..

* Don't you love it when open source folks [fight among each other][235]? I
  thought this whole thing was about cooperation.

* A rant sent in by a reader about [Linux and Marketing][236].

* Another rant that [shoots down common Linux claims][237].

* A blog post suggesting that [making your software free is a good approach
  amidst this global credit crisis][238]. Right, because if you "Sell customers
  what they need, in their eyes its \_just\_ the right amount of support. Often
  this will exceed or equal the amount that youâ€™d gain via licensing." And yea,
  when exactly are they going to buy this support? Like as a contract? Up front?
  So you're charging them more? And that's supposed to be attractive to them?

[238]: http://echoreply.us/tech/2008/10/07/yet-another-reason-to-floss/

* And finally, I thought Linux was about freedom and choice, and that extends to
  Satan warshippers. Apparently, [distrowatch doesn't think so][239].

It was fun while it lasted folks. I'm closing up shop. Moving on.

It turns out, the more hate I dished out, the less I had to hate on. Lusers keep
making the same damn mistakes. These days, I wonder if they're not producing yet
another 10-reasons-why-Linux-is-better article just to rope me along.

Let's just say, eventually, one moves beyond anger. Like the five phases of
grief, or something. Eventually you get to acceptance. Accepting that lusers are
going to continue in their freetarded ways whatever you do, however much you try
to embarass them in a public forum.

So in true open source fashion, as the maintainer of this project, I am going to
arbitrarily drop off the face off the of this earth for purely selfish reasons,
and leave the entire cause in limbo. That is how open source projects truly die.
But hey, all the material is out there for y'all to see (it's "open source" in
it's own way), so maybe someone else will take up the cause. Carry on, lusers!
