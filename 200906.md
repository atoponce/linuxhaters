### To all you mono haters

Take [that][253].

But seriuosly. Why don't we all just wait another 20 years until everyone
forgets that C# came from Microsoft. Then can we use it? I'm sure by then, the
real OS'es of the world will have moved onto something even more productive, and
freetards will continue to re-discover everything all over again.

Oh, and btw. Gnote is the most retardonkulous project ever. Could you guys also
port Banshee, Beagle and F-spot too? Fuck. Not only do you guys waste your time
creating busted clones of proprietary software, now you're creating busted
clones of free software too? Amazing.

Actually, I don't think my left buttcheek agrees with C++. Could we please get a
port of Gnote to assembly code?

Oh wait, I think there's a lot of IP in intel x86 assembly. Hmm, how about then
you port it to something that runs on the OGP card. That would be, like, totally
awesome.

### The fail train that is Munich

An entire blog dedicated to the failure that is the Munich Linux transition.

Hopefully the rest of Germany and Europe can learn from Munich's mistakes.

Why don't we all go over to this guy's blog and give him a nice warm hug.
