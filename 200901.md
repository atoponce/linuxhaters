### For fuck's sake

Did y’all not learn anything? Was all that ranting and flaming for naught?

Looks like I managed to ruffle a few feathers, but it looks like bringing about
real change is going to take a bit more effort.

I had to go because, well, I didn’t have time for this shit. But now I have a
little, so I’m back like drobbins. I can’t spend as much time as I used to, but
hopefully enough to make Obama happy that I responded to his call to action.

A lot has happened in the last three months. Much of it awful, most of it
hilarious. I won’t go into much in this post. Instead, I’ll just link to a few
articles that made me smile (a hateful smile, of course). I’m rich bitches!

Actually, I’m not. Well then, at least…

I’m famous bitches!

Oh wait, nobody knows who I am.

Sigh...

### Wobbly Compiz

Ah Compiz, the darling of the freetard community. How many users were led to
carnal bliss by your wobbling windows? How many were not heard from for several
weeks as they navigated the wild expanse known as the CompizConfig Settings
Manager?

Oh what is that you say LWN, diligent summarizer of freetardery? You say [compiz
is dying][242]? And in true open source fashion?

All I have to say is:

AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA

Wasn’t this the project that was finally supposed to bring Linux ahead of the
desktop OS pack? Don’t worry about shitty drivers or not being able to smoothly
resize windows. This is hot shit man! I fuckin’ replaced by bedroom window with
saran wrap so that, it too, could wobble.

C’mon guys. This is your star player, your poster child, the shining example of
what OSS can accomplish, better and faster than those commercial companies, and
you freetards can’t even keep that going. The rest of the article is
depressingly typical, of course.. too few developers, too many branches, no
leadership, bad code, blah blah blah blah.

But there’s a great little suggestion at the end:

> But it may be that, now that the novelty of 3-D special effects have worn off,
> few reasons exist to develop them; the few practical effects, such as zooms,
> are too slight to encourage the majority to move away from standard 2-D
> desktops.

Wait, are you suggesting that a bunch of freetards got excited by a little
bling, and went gung-ho on a new project, hyped it to the max (take that
Microsoft and Apple!), without first thinking about whether they’re actually
solving a user’s problem? Why, freetards would never do that… would they?

You guys need to wake the fuck up. No amount of wobbling is going to make a user
switch to Linux and like it. I think they just might actually want working
wireless and cool games, and fonts that don’t make you cry. But that’s just my
hunch. Feel free to continue ignoring it.

And even if you’re going to keep working on this, why not try to do it in a way
that doesn’t break shit that already worked? Like video? or OpenGL apps? I don’t
care if a baboon wrote the drivers for my graphics card. It used to work. Now it
doesn’t. FAIL.

Oh, and let me tell you a little secret: You can get wobbly windows on any
platform, even Win95! Just browse to your favorite porn site, start a video, let
your left hand do its thing (or your right, if you’re left-handed, of course),
and at the same time drag a window around. If you don’t see it, just try harder.
At the end, you might even get a cool Compiz-like liquid-on-your-screen effect.

### A River of Fail

[//p109]: # (https://web.archive.org/web/20171013133137/http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2009/01/river-of-fail.html)

A lot of you KDEtards seemed to have pissed your pants when Linus recently said
that he switched to Gnome.  And then a bunch of other people showed up and tried
to say what this says about KDE, or what it means for Gnome, and blah blah blah.

In actuality, this whole situation is just a culmination of one FAIL after
another.

First, there was KDE itself. I won’t get into the fact that C++ still makes for
a terrible desktop platform from the point of view of anyone who wants to deploy
an app. But after a while, even the KDE folks managed to make some people happy,
and then they iterated to make a few more happy. There was progress.

Then came KDE 4.0. I’ve already written about how messed up that release was.
“Hey everyone! we’re calling it a .0\* !”

\* it’s not really a .0

Then there was Linus, who for some god forsaken reason uses Fedora. I would
already claim FAIL here, but whatever, that’s his choice.

Then there’s KDE 4.0 in Fedora. Apparently, the Fedora folks didn’t get the note
about how 4.0 isn’t really 4.0. Oh, but the best part is, there’s a nice little
Wiki page that talks about Fedora’s [plans to include KDE4 at the time][243].

[243]: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/FeatureKDE4

What was the supposed “benefit to Fedora”?

> KDE 4.0 will be released a few months before Fedora 9, and is already
> feature-frozen now, therefore we expect this to be a relatively low-risk
> upgrade (as low-risk as a move to a new major version with significant changes
> can be). We believe that it is necessary to make this move now to keep in line
> with Fedora's mission of showcasing leading-edge technology.

Sweet! a low-risk opportunity to showcase leading-edge brokenness. Sign me the
fuck up!

Wait, there was a “Test Plan”?

> KDE-based Fedora installations will need to be tested very carefully because
> of the major changes. Anything which doesn't use KDE shouldn't be affected and
> will thus need no or only minimal retesting.

Uhh, FAIL FAIL FAIL?

So let’s summarize.

* KDE fails for producing a release that nobody wants, and expects everyone to
  read the fine print after naming it what everyone else in the world would
  interpret as stable release intended for the masses.
* Fedora fails for underestimating what it means to move to KDE4, and
  prioritizing shininess over workingness.
* Linus fails for not knowing better. By definition, he’s been around the Linux
  scene the longest. He should have known.

The best part is, if you read Linus’ actual interview, it’s clear that the man
doesn’t give a flying fuck about all this. As usual, it’s all the surrounding
clueless freetards with unjustified notions of grandeur that have got their
panties in a knot.

BTW, I don’t know whether to write another post about it, but I tried a KDE 4.2
liveCD, and it was another fantastic example of faildom. But hey, at least I
could rotate my plasmoids. Using a calculator at 45 degrees is more fun then I
ever imagined.
