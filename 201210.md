It appears as if good ol' Mr. Shuttleworth has finally [seen the light][268].

In other words: freetards will be freetards.

### Fragmentation

More evidence of cluelessness. In a weird late night rage, against my better
judgement, I found myself reading this article over at Phoronix, about how
[Ubuntu is thinking about an SDK][269].

Anyone who's been around long enough knows that any time some one of people
tries to move the ball forward by doing something different, everyone thinks
it's their right to crap on them. Worrying about fragmentation is the fucking
dumbest thing you could do at this particular moment.

**Desktop Linux is already heavily fragmented**. The benefit of potentially
getting major app developers to sign up far outweighs any incremental
fragmentation this might create. In fact, if this actually works, I predict that
suddenly every other freetard distriution will offer SDK compatibility, and then
spew on about how open source is great because it allows all kinds of variation
while keeping compatibility. In other words, you will see someone writing a blog
post about how you can run Steam in XMonad. Because that's totally relevant, and
it's the one thing that desktop Linux is missing.

**It's not about how many incompatible choices there are, it's about how your
users are distributed**. Nobody gives a shit about how Ubuntu creating a stable
SDK makes life harder for some crack-laced minty fresh Ubuntu derivative. Ubuntu
already has a lot of users, if not the majority of desktop Linux users. That
means this move could make desktop Linux better for the majority of users. If
some big ISV signs on, it could mean that there are now 5x more Ubuntu users,
making it by far the biggest majority. When Ubuntu grows the market by 5x, and
owns 80% of it, the Linux desktop userbase is now less fragmented than where it
started.

**Fragmentation doesn't mean shit when the market is so small**. Freetards argue
about how things are fragmented for the 1%. Well, when you only have 1%, the
problem isn't that you're too fragmented. The problem is you're not doing the
right things to grow beyond 1%. Fragmentation is a problem for Android. Not
desktop Linux.
