I was just taking a look at S-man's announcement for Ubuntu Unity and Light
versions. Most of it is blah, except for this tidbit:

> ... The dual-boot, web-focused use case is sufficiently different from
> general-purpose desktop usage to warrant a fresh look at the way the desktop
> is configured. **_We spent quite a bit of time analyzing screenshots of a
> couple of hundred different desktop configurations from the current Ubuntu and
> Kubuntu user base, to see what people used most_**. We also identified the
> things that are NOT needed in lightweight dual-boot instant-on offerings...

Wut. Ok. Let me learn you something. I've seen lots of Linux screenshots in my
time. If you were actually optimizing for the freetard, basically what you'd
have is a desktop with two semi-transparent terminals. One tailing a syslog, and
another showing an irc session. Oh and like some pager with a bazillion virtual
desktops that are totally useless. Oh, and don't forget the scantily-clad,
objectified female as the wallpaper image.

As for the rest of the article? OMG, You put a fucking dock on the side. In OSX
and Win7, doing the same thing takes like 3 seconds. Do you really need to write
a whole giant announcement about it?

Oh and I like the two sections at the end, about "Relationship to Gnome Shell"
and "Relationship to KDE". Even the S-man has figured out that you can't just go
"*innovate*" in the OSS community without shouting out to everyone. Because we
don't want to piss off the ten people who care about Gnome Shell or KDE. Fuck.
Could you imagine an Apple announcement saying something like "Relationship to
Windows"?
